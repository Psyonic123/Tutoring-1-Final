# Tutoring-1-Final
The final project from the first tutoring lecture. We learned how to use HTML and CSS to make basic webpages. Now we will finish a component for a "client" based on a UI/UX design


Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

Clone, then branch this repo. After making your changes, make a pull request and I'll check it out and give feedback.
